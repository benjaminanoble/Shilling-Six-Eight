      <h3 style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">Software Engineering at Academy Xi</h3>
      <p>In reflection on the past two weeks in the Software Engineering Transform course I am thrilled to have made it this far and look forward to the future.. The transition from full time design room manager to a student has been scary but as the information slowly seeps in and digital content appears on my computer screen i am growing more confident day by day.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?</p>
      <p>Ready to try something new, new career direction</p>
      <p>I have had a long career in the design world, running design teams within the surf / street  fashion industry. This experience taught me how to solve problems and communicate a strong brand direction. I want to take this and move into a digital world as the planet is doing. This lead me to the Software Engineering course that will combine creative and analytical thinking to build quick, efficient, and effective web content.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">What went well? - Key Learnings.</p>
        <p>Challenging yet Rewarding</p>
      <p>It has been exciting to re-train the brain to take information in after many years of cruising within a safe work environment. From not understanding anything to knowing something is a great personal growth indicator and keeps spirits high to move onwords.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">What could have been improved?</p>
      <p>Research and Development</p>
      <p>In hindsight I would have come in with more knowledge from the wonderful world of Google / Youtube. To have a higher basic undersatnding would help move forward quicker and stop the feeeling of complete dispair that you know nothing.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">The key take aways.</p>
      <p>Resilience and Perseverance</p>
      <p>"The fact of continuing in an opinion or course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition." The key take outs is that you don't get it right first time and that keeping at it will birth a solution and the knowledge to move forward in the future. Persistence is a fundamental trait to develop in life because it is closely related to personal development and improvement.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(207, 184, 107);;">The process you followed?</p>
      <p>Finding Joy in Repetition</p>
      <p>“We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” — Walt Disney</p> 
      <p>The continual making of mistakes and learning from those will all work out in the long run. It is not a sprint and repetition will be the way to move forward and learn. I am excited for the future within the software engineering scope.
