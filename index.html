      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Ben arrived on earth clutching a box of crayons in one hand and a drawing book in the other. Early life
        drawing classes with the crazy hippies out the back of Bellingen on the North NSW Coast led to an interest in
        art but quickly gave him cause to leave that free and easy life and head to the big smoke for some real
        training. Years of slaving away surfing and doodling lead to an Art Express exhibition and a Design bachelor
        degree.Following this he soon realised that living on the pens is a hard way to make a crust which led to a
        second degree in Fashion and he focused all his energy on getting some free threads. When not designing, Ben
        can be found in front of a computer drawing or hunched over a beer coaster contemplating the ultimate design
        for world domination.

          <h3>Wax-head</h3>
          <p>This glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject.[a][b] In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.
            The term surfing usually refers to the act of riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
